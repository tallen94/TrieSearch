Web Role 
- Trie Search


Web Service:
	
- 3 Web Methods: DownloadWiki, BuildTrie, GetSuggestions
	
- DownloadWiki: Downloads the blob file and saves it to disk (I scraped invalid characters before uploading it to the blob container)
	
- BuildTrie: Reads from the downloaded file and builds a trie tree. I leave 200 MB of memory, which seems to give sufficient performance
and I can get to around words that start with v.
	
- Get Suggestions: Traverses the trie tree to the end of the given sequence and returns the first 10 suggestions results below that.

Classes: 
	
- Trie Node: A node used in a Trie tree. Contains a letter and dictionary of children with the keys being the letters of the child nodes. 
I used a dictionary for fast access when searching the trie tree. Instead of searching a list for the next letter in O(n), I get O(1) to find the next node. 
	
- Trie Tree: A trie search tree that does a dfs when searching for suggestions. Given a seqence of characters, it traverses the tree to the last known character and 
will return the first 10 suggestions below it. I stopped at 10 to improve the request time.

Client Side:
	- Watches the text input and makes an ajax request to the asmx 
service on every key stroke
