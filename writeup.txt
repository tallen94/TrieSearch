Search Engine Assignment 4

Requirements:

End-To-End experience
- The only thing I could not get working is the nba player stats. 
- It will automatically search on each keypress if the query is > 2 characters
- Pressing enter or search will force a search for the current query
- Results are sorted by how many times each word in the query shows up in the title. If the result contains the index.html page it gets bumped up but still wont be enough to beat queries that are more relevant to the title. It then looks at how many segments are in the url path, if there are less it moves up because paths like /politics are more popular than /politics/blah/stuff/foo/page.html. The last thing is when the last modification was made if it is known. 

The way I store entites in the table are the partition key is each unique word it comes across and the rowkey is the title/url that contains that word. This makes it super easy to query, where you just select from the table the partitionkey equal to each word in the query. Then sorting becomes easy with linq. You order by the count of each url title, then by rank, then lastmod.

I paginate the data by grouping it into arrays of 20. Each new search gets cached and when the number for the page is clicked, it can quickly search the cache for the query and page number.

There is query caching on the front end as well. On every key press, the previous queries are searched and ones that contain what is being typed are ordered by Levenshtein distance and the first one is queried. There is a delay between each key press of 500ms. If what currently is in the search box is eqaul to what was in it 500ms ago, the search will happen. This is to prevent every letter type executing a search, since the user isnt actually searching for each segment. They only want the search that shows up when they stop typing. 

If a similar previous query is found it is added to the top of the search suggestions when the user is typing in the search box. Search suggestions are also clickable and will perform a search.
